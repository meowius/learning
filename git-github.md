> "One frustrating aspect of becoming a Software Developer is that the tools and technologies you have to learn are rarely explained or written about from a beginnerâ€™s perspective. I often find I have to read a couple of articles on a certain topic to get a full understanding â€“ even when the topic turns out to be incredibly basic when you finally understand it. Software documentation is usually one of the worst offenders in this arena."
